          <p>
            Basically my journey started from 2011 when I got my first laptop shared with my family members. I have been playing old arcade games, just because they were friendly and funny. 
          </p>
          <p>
            2 months (or so?) later I had discovered Youtube and first betas of Minecraft. I was so excited about it, so I started to watch videos about the game. The first one was about redstone. Up to 2013 I was playing the beta versions of Minecraft, then I got able to play Modded Minecraft starting from beta 1.9.1 with IndustrialCraft 2, BuildCraft and TooManyItems as far as I know. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I started playing more modern versions such as 1.2.5, 1.5.2. Mostly I played 1.5.2 up to time when I was able to buy the game, because the launcher was changed and basically reworked from scratch. I played a lot of modpacks, but the most favourite one was Tekkit Classic. I was playing it for a long time, but then I got bored and started to play other modpacks. Up to 2024 I have completed mostly 2000 of modpacks and still counting.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of 2020 I started playing other games, because I was feeling that I'm getting tired from Minecraft. Seriously, I was playing it literally more than 40k hours (if MultiMC stats not wrong, lol) and I needed a break from the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was streaming on Twitch for a while. I was streaming mostly Minecraft, but sometimes I was streaming other games such as DOOM, Halo, etc, because my viewers requested them in Discord. So, after 2020 I started discovering different games and now I'm feeling much better about gaming, because I used to play only Minecraft and nothing else. I wanted to play only MC before.
          </p>
          <p>
            When 2022 started, I started to get much better at programming and started progressively modding the games and started coding cool stuff and doing variety stuff. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also discovered Destiny 2, thanks to my friends. I had played it 2000 hours and counting, but I felt that was a bit boring as of the start of 2024, so I only complete challenges or raids/dungeons with my friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also played DOOM a lot and this game motivated me to do something in my life. I was playing it for a long time and I have completed it on Nightmare difficulty. It was en exciting journey and memorizable one, so I started to show interest in space-related projects and in science fiction. It motivated me to learn more about space and space exploration. We will talk about it later.

          <p>
            What about my life? For years I had somewhat default lifecycle. I was doing nothing special. It was a boring experience going to school or university, then doing some tasks and going to sleep. I tried to learn something new everyday, so I started to show interest in Java in 2014 and was learning it for a bit.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2022 I've noticed that I need to change something in my life and was searching for a hobby. After some time I found one: Diving. I was diving for a year and it was a great experience. I have met a lot of new people and I have seen a bunch of new places. However, it is a very expensive hobby, so I'm saving some of my money for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2023 I have started to show interest in astronomics and space exploration. Well, just because I like science fiction a lot. Mostly after completing the whole Halo series. I wish to step on Mars one day, but I know that it is impossible for me, because I'm not a scientist or an engineer. I'm just a programmer, but I try my best to bring my dream into reality. I always wanted to discover some secrets, that no one else have done or discovered before. I'm also interested in space exploration and I'm trying to learn something new about it everyday. If you want to help me to achieve my dream, I would be really appreciated! No, seriously. I would be really happy to work with you on some space-related projects or even get atleast once to the Mars.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that everything is possible, so I'm trying to do my best to achieve my goals. I'm also trying to help other people to achieve their goals, because I know how it feels when you are alone and no one is helping you. I'm trying to help people as much as I can.
