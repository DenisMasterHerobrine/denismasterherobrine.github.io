        <div class="merriweather-text">
          <p>I have done a lot of stuff since 2015. Starting from writing my first "Hello World" Java program in 2015 and creating MCreator mods for Minecraft videogame, ending up with a full stack desktop Java/C# (WPF) applications in 2023 and modding existing games such as Minecraft, Terraria, Risk of Rain 2, The Long Dark and so on.</p>
          <p>I have learned a lot of things, and I am still learning. I have a lot of projects, but I have only listed the ones I am most proud of. You can see most of them in my GitHub profile since they have sources.</p>

          <p>Also I did a lot of comissioned plugins for Spigot/Paper server software mostly about changing the whole Minecraft mechanics or doing some optimizations to them. I had also several attempts at creating fully multithreaded Minecraft server software. The most successfull attempt was called Chromite and created in January 2021. It was for Minecraft versions from 1.15 up to 1.16.4, but abandoned in the middle of 2021 due to lack of Java knowledge in specific aspects and no free time to work on it due to exams.</p>
          <p>Speaking of Chromite, it was a massive Minecraft game overhaul with an attempt of keeping vanilla behaviour as same as possible, but providing performance boost where possible. Me and some YouTubers were doing some public tests on it, and it was a success. It was able to handle ~200 players on a single server with 20 TPS and somewhat low CPU usage. Sadly, it is private and contains a lot of weird code snippets even having experience in Java.</p>
          <p>Some videos may be found around the YouTube from public tests from minigames I made, so you can check some examples below.</p>
          <ul>

          <p>Also I had done a bunch of comissioned mods for various YouTubers. List of them you can find here: (there are also some of my comissioned maps/plugins)</p>

            I also had created some Minecraft servers and networks, but they're mostly private or available for paid subscribers. As of May 2022 and still counting, I'm working on <a href="https://shield.land/">SHIELD.LAND</a> network as a Java Junior Developer and writing some Minecraft plugins/Java stuff for it.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have done some other Minecraft mods and plugins, but they're mostly private and not available for public or being unreleased due to their quality. One of the examples of it: DonationAlerts Minecraft integration. I did created several modpacks from scratch for different streamers and YouTubers. Some of them are still using them.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I have done a lot of mods for other games, such as Terraria, Risk of Rain 2, The Long Dark, etc. They're mostly private and not available for public.

          <p>
            I have started learning C++ in 2022 and created several applications since then. I had learned Python in 2022 and C# in 2023. I have somewhat understanding of WPF and how it works, previously I had some experience with JavaFX, but I didn't liked it.
            Some of my applications are available on GitHub, but most of them are private and not available for public.
